1.
Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

Example 1:

Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
Example 2:

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
 
Constraints:

-231 <= x <= 231 - 1

class Solution(object):
    def isPalindrome(self, x):
        if x < 0:
            return False
        reverse = 0
        temporary = x
        while temporary > 0:
            digit = temporary % 10
            reverse = reverse * 10 + digit
            temporary = temporary / 10
        return reverse == x              
       
2.
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Example 1:

Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

Example 2:

Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]

class Solution:
    def reverseString(self, s: List[str]) -> None:
        left = 0
        right = len(s) - 1
        while left < right:
            s[left], s[right] = s[right], s[left]
            left += 1
            right -= 1
        return s

3.
Given a string s, reverse only all the vowels in the string and return it.

The vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u', and they can appear in both lower and upper cases, more than once.

Example 1:

Input: s = "IceCreAm"

Output: "AceCreIm"

Explanation:

The vowels in s are ['I', 'e', 'e', 'A']. On reversing the vowels, s becomes "AceCreIm".

Example 2:

Input: s = "leetcode"

Output: "leotcede"


Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 3 * 105
s consist of printable ASCII characters.

class Solution(object):
    def reverseVowels(self, s):
        vowels = set('aeiouAEIOU')
        list1 = list(s)
        left = 0
        right = len(s) - 1
        while left < right:
            if list1[left] not in vowels:
                left = left + 1
            if list1[right] not in vowels:
                right = right - 1
            if list1[left] in vowels and list1[right] in vowels:
                list1[left], list1[right] = list1[right], list1[left]
                left = left + 1
                right = right - 1
        return ''.join(list1)

4.
Given a string s, reverse the string according to the following rules:

All the characters that are not English letters remain in the same position.
All the English letters (lowercase or uppercase) should be reversed.
Return s after reversing it.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "ab-cd"
Output: "dc-ba"
Example 2:

Input: s = "a-bC-dEf-ghIj"
Output: "j-Ih-gfE-dCba"
Example 3:

Input: s = "Test1ng-Leet=code-Q!"
Output: "Qedo1ct-eeLg=ntse-T!"
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 100
s consists of characters with ASCII values in the range [33, 122].
s does not contain '\"' or '\\'.

class Solution(object):
    def reverseOnlyLetters(self, s):
        def isletter(ch):
            return ('A' <= ch <= 'Z') or ('a' <= ch <= 'z')
        list1 = list(s)
        left = 0
        right = len(s) - 1
        while left < right:
            if not isletter(list1[left]):
                left = left + 1
            if not isletter(list1[right]):
                right = right - 1
            if isletter(list1[left]) and isletter(list1[right]):
                list1[left], list1[right] = list1[right], list1[left]
                left = left + 1
                right = right - 1
        return ''.join(list1)

5.
Given a string s, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it does not exist, return -1.

Example 1:

Input: s = "leetcode"

Output: 0

Explanation:

The character 'l' at index 0 is the first character that does not occur at any other index.

Example 2:

Input: s = "loveleetcode"

Output: 2

Example 3:

Input: s = "aabb"

Output: -1

    def firstUniqChar(self, s):
        l = []
        for i in s:
            if i not in l:
                l.append(i)
        for i in l:
            if s.count(i) = 1:
                return s.find(i)
        return -1

6.
Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

Example 1:

Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
Output: 0
Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.
Example 2:

Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
Output: -1
Explanation: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.

Mode: Easy

class Solution(object):
    def strStr(self, haystack, needle):
        if needle == "":
            return 0
        for i in range(len(haystack) + 1 - len(needle)):
            if haystack[i:i+len(needle)] == needle:
                return i
        return -1

7.
Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

Example 1:

Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5
Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.
Example 2:

Input: s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "
Output: 4
Explanation: The last word is "moon" with length 4.
Example 3:

Input: s = "luffy is still joyboy"
Output: 6
Explanation: The last word is "joyboy" with length 6.

class Solution(object):
    def lengthOfLastWord(self, s):

                if s[i] != " ":
                    count = count + 1
                elif count > 0:
                    return count
            return count

8.
Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

Example 1:

Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"

Output: true

Example 2:

Input: s = "rat", t = "car"

Output: false

Mode: Easy

class Solution(object):
    def isAnagram(self, s, t):
        return Counter(s) == Counter(t)

9.
Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

Example 1:

Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false

Mode: Easy
Company: Amazon, Google, Yandex, Adobe

class Solution(object):
    def isSubsequence(self, s, t):
        i = 0 # Pointer for s
        for char in t:
            if i < len(s) and s[i] == char:
                i = i + 1
        return i == len(s)

10.
We define the usage of capitals in a word to be right when one of the following cases holds:

All letters in this word are capitals, like "USA".
All letters in this word are not capitals, like "leetcode".
Only the first letter in this word is capital, like "Google".
Given a string word, return true if the usage of capitals in it is right.

Example 1:

Input: word = "USA"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: word = "FlaG"
Output: false

Mode: Easy
Company: Google, Amazon

class Solution(object):
    def detectCapitalUse(self, word):
        return (word.istitle() or word.isupper() or word.islower())

11.A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.

Example 1:

Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.
Example 2:

Input: s = "race a car"
Output: false
Explanation: "raceacar" is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: s = " "
Output: true
Explanation: s is an empty string "" after removing non-alphanumeric characters.
Since an empty string reads the same forward and backward, it is a palindrome.

class Solution(object):
    def isPalindrome(self, s):
        s = s.lower()
        temp = ""
        for char in s:
            if char.isalnum():
                temp = temp + char
        return temp == temp[::-1]
