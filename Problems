Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

Example 1:

Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
Example 2:

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
 
Constraints:

-231 <= x <= 231 - 1
 
Follow up: Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?

            return False
        reverse = 0
        temporary = x
        while temporary > 0:
            digit = temporary % 10
            reverse = reverse * 10 + digit
            temporary = temporary / 10
        return reverse == x              
       
2.
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Example 1:

Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

Example 2:

Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]

        left = 0
        right = len(s) - 1
        while left < right:
            s[left], s[right] = s[right], s[left]
            left += 1
            right -= 1
        return s

3.
Given a string s, reverse only all the vowels in the string and return it.

The vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u', and they can appear in both lower and upper cases, more than once.

Example 1:

Input: s = "IceCreAm"

Output: "AceCreIm"

Explanation:

The vowels in s are ['I', 'e', 'e', 'A']. On reversing the vowels, s becomes "AceCreIm".

Example 2:

Input: s = "leetcode"

Output: "leotcede"


Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 3 * 105
s consist of printable ASCII characters.

        right = len(s) - 1
        while left < right:
            if list1[left] not in vowels:
                left = left + 1
            if list1[right] not in vowels:
                right = right - 1
            if list1[left] in vowels and list1[right] in vowels:
                list1[left], list1[right] = list1[right], list1[left]
                left = left + 1
                right = right - 1
        return ''.join(list1)

4.
Given a string s, reverse the string according to the following rules:

All the characters that are not English letters remain in the same position.
All the English letters (lowercase or uppercase) should be reversed.
Return s after reversing it.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "ab-cd"
Output: "dc-ba"
Example 2:

Input: s = "a-bC-dEf-ghIj"
Output: "j-Ih-gfE-dCba"
Example 3:

Input: s = "Test1ng-Leet=code-Q!"
Output: "Qedo1ct-eeLg=ntse-T!"
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 100
s consists of characters with ASCII values in the range [33, 122].
s does not contain '\"' or '\\'.

            if isletter(list1[left]) and isletter(list1[right]):
                list1[left], list1[right] = list1[right], list1[left]
                left = left + 1
                right = right - 1
        return ''.join(list1)

5.
Given a string s, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it does not exist, return -1.

Example 1:

Input: s = "leetcode"

Output: 0

Explanation:

The character 'l' at index 0 is the first character that does not occur at any other index.

Example 2:

Input: s = "loveleetcode"

Output: 2

Example 3:

Input: s = "aabb"

Output: -1

                l.append(i)
        for i in l:
            if s.count(i) = 1:
                return s.find(i)
        return -1

6.
Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

Example 1:

Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
Output: 0
Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.
Example 2:

Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
Output: -1
Explanation: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.

Mode: Easy

class Solution(object):
    def strStr(self, haystack, needle):
        if needle == "":
            return 0
        for i in range(len(haystack) + 1 - len(needle)):

                return i
        return -1

7.
Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

Example 1:

Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5
Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.
Example 2:

Input: s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "
Output: 4
Explanation: The last word is "moon" with length 4.
Example 3:

Input: s = "luffy is still joyboy"
Output: 6
Explanation: The last word is "joyboy" with length 6.

            return count

8.
Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

Example 1:

Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"

Output: true

Example 2:

Input: s = "rat", t = "car"

    def isAnagram(self, s, t):
        return Counter(s) == Counter(t)

9.
Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

Example 1:

Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false

            if i < len(s) and s[i] == char:
                i = i + 1
        return i == len(s)

10.
We define the usage of capitals in a word to be right when one of the following cases holds:

All letters in this word are capitals, like "USA".
All letters in this word are not capitals, like "leetcode".
Only the first letter in this word is capital, like "Google".
Given a string word, return true if the usage of capitals in it is right.

Example 1:

Input: word = "USA"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: word = "FlaG"
Output: false

class Solution(object):
    def detectCapitalUse(self, word):
        return (word.istitle() or word.isupper() or word.islower())

11.A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.

Example 1:

Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.
Example 2:

Input: s = "race a car"
Output: false
Explanation: "raceacar" is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: s = " "
Output: true
Explanation: s is an empty string "" after removing non-alphanumeric characters.
Since an empty string reads the same forward and backward, it is a palindrome.

class Solution(object):
    def isPalindrome(self, s):
        s = s.lower()
        temp = ""
        for char in s:
            if char.isalnum():
                temp = temp + char
        return temp == temp[::-1]

12.
Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,2,1]

Output: 1

Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]

Output: 4

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1]

Output: 1

            if j == 1:
                return i

13.
Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2

Mode: Easy

class Solution(object):
    def majorityElement(self, nums):
        temp = Counter(nums)
        n = len(nums)
        for i, j in temp.items():
            if j > n/2:
                return i

14.
Given two strings s and goal, return true if and only if s can become goal after some number of shifts on s.

A shift on s consists of moving the leftmost character of s to the rightmost position.

For example, if s = "abcde", then it will be "bcdea" after one shift.

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcde", goal = "cdeab"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "abcde", goal = "abced"
Output: false

Mode: Easy

class Solution(object):
    def rotateString(self, s, goal):
        if len(s) == len(goal) and goal in (s + s):
            return True
        else:
            return False

15.
Given a string s, return the string after replacing every uppercase letter with the same lowercase letter.

Example 1:

A word is considered valid if:

It contains a minimum of 3 characters.
It contains only digits (0-9), and English letters (uppercase and lowercase).
It includes at least one vowel.
It includes at least one consonant.
You are given a string word.

Return true if word is valid, otherwise, return false.

Notes:

'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', and their uppercases are vowels.
A consonant is an English letter that is not a vowel.

Example 1:

Input: word = "234Adas"

Output: true

Explanation:

This word satisfies the conditions.

Example 2:

Input: word = "b3"

Output: false

Explanation:

The length of this word is fewer than 3, and does not have a vowel.

Example 3:

Input: word = "a3$e"

Output: false

Explanation:

This word contains a '$' character and does not have a consonant.

Mode: Easy

class Solution(object):
    def isValid(self, word):

        vowels = ['a','e','i','o','u','A','E','I','O','U']
        
        if lenn < 3:
            return False

        for i in word:
            if i in digits:
                continue # Skip
            elif (65 <= ord(i) <= 90) or (97 <= ord(i) <= 122):
                if i in vowels:
                    countv = countv + 1
                else:
                    countc = countc + 1
            else:
                return False # When it contains special characters like $,%, etc

        if countv >= 1 and countc >= 1:
            return True
        else:
            return False

17.
Given two non-negative integers, num1 and num2 represented as string, return the sum of num1 and num2 as a string.

You must solve the problem without using any built-in library for handling large integers (such as BigInteger). You must also not convert the inputs to integers directly.

Example 1:

Input: num1 = "11", num2 = "123"
Output: "134"
Example 2:

Input: num1 = "456", num2 = "77"
Output: "533"

        return str(result)

18.
Given two strings s and goal, return true if you can swap two letters in s so the result is equal to goal, otherwise, return false.

Swapping letters is defined as taking two indices i and j (0-indexed) such that i != j and swapping the characters at s[i] and s[j].

For example, swapping at indices 0 and 2 in "abcd" results in "cbad".

Example 1:

Input: s = "ab", goal = "ba"
Output: true
Explanation: You can swap s[0] = 'a' and s[1] = 'b' to get "ba", which is equal to goal.
Example 2:

Input: s = "ab", goal = "ab"
Output: false
Explanation: The only letters you can swap are s[0] = 'a' and s[1] = 'b', which results in "ba" != goal.
Example 3:

Input: s = "aa", goal = "aa"
Output: true
Explanation: You can swap s[0] = 'a' and s[1] = 'a' to get "aa", which is equal to goal.

        if len(diff) == 2:
            i, j = diff
            return s[i] == goal[j] and s[j] == goal[i]

        return False

19.
Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

Example 1:

Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"
Example 2:

Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.

            base7 = '-' + base7
        
        return base7

22.
You are given two strings s and t.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to t.

Example 1:
